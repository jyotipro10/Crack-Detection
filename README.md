# Crack-Detection
Detect crack and classify image as cracked and uncracked

### Crack detection
This project is on image classification problem using deep convolutional neural networks.\
The dataset consists of images obtained from concrete bridge decks, pavements, and walls.\
The images can contain either cracks or no cracks. We have to develop a binary image
classification model that can classify from a given image if it contains any cracks or not.
#### The trained model gives ~87.4% on test data and gives ~88.8% on random test data.

### Datasets
Datasets can be found on kaggle(Due to large size). Link is provided below.\
